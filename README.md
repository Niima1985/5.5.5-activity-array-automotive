# Activity Automative

- In this lesson students work on sub-classing a base vehicle class
- to do this we need a way of importing / using code from a different file...

[Official Node.js docs](https://nodejs.org/docs/v0.4.2/api/modules.html#all_Together...)

Acceptance Criteria


When reviewing the file structure, both vehicle.js and mercurySedan.js must be present.
When viewing mercurySedan.js, vehicleModule must be imported.
When viewing mercurySedan.js, the file must include a Car class that extends vehicleModule.
When viewing mercurySedan.js, the Car class must include a constructor that implements the super keyword.
When viewing mercurySedan.js, the Car class must include all properties and methods defined in the activity.
